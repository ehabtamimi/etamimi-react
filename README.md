# App Description:

It's a web application built using the React TypeScript framework on the client side, which utilizes the Spoonacular API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs) to fetch data from the client side and display recipes in an appealing manner.

There are two main features of this application:

## Search for recipes:

On the homepage, we use an appropriate API to enable recipe searches. Search results should display the recipe image and provide some description about each recipe.

## Display information about recipes:

We use an appropriate API to create a user interface for displaying details about a specific recipe when the user selects a search result. In the detailed view of the recipe, an image illustrating the recipe will be displayed.

### Below is an example that shows how to use the app:

Go to this page: https://ehabtamimi.github.io/etamimi-react/
Select a query such as "Pasta" or "Burger."
Add 800 as the maximum calories.
Check the "Fill Ingredients" checkbox.
Click submit.
